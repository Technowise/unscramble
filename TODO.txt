"In the future, you may benefit from:
using webviews
giving non-mods post creation access. Posting the guess as a comment with spoiler treatment would allow you to ensure words are moderated OR you could use a dictionary of words
"


Give a hint to solve (like the word starts with letter X) after a minute has passed.

Add postId into all redis keys so that they do not collide with other posts.

Periodically refresh the values of words, words-title and minutes value in redis so that it does not expire.
Make minutesToSolve to come from redis instead of fixed constant.
Add leaderboard with number of names solved by each user. - Done.
Add form to get input of character names and TV Show name while creating post. Optional input for background image.
Add Help section.
Add Readme file.


TODO: Figure out why user status letters are not refreshing when the letters have become stale. - Done

Show seconds remaining to solve, update it every 5 seconds. - Postponed for later implementation.
Add created timestamp to the namesandletters object, show countdown timer for time left to solve the present letters.

Make the UI and letters similar to Literati game(yahoo).
Store the current letters set in redis, rotate it every 10 minutes (or when both the names are guessed).
Align the letter tiles to left.
Add button to reset (move all characters back at once)
Maintain points to users based on number of correct words, create leaderboard.
After certain time, show hint for the names with starting letter if nobody answered for a while.

devvit game idea:

In comic/Sitcom related subreddits, show a set of letters (from names taken from sitcom characters), arrange them in random order, ask the users to make/find names.
As soon as someone makes a name, it is shown in the screen for everyone with the username. There will be time limit set, after which it shows the set of names.

There will be 5 minutes bracket to solve the puzzle. Whoever finishes the maximum number of names will become winner. Each win will add point to user for the leaderboard. Name once solved by one person cannot be solved by another user in the same batch.


Additional features:
1) Option for mods to set the background image for the game.
2) Option to set colors for the letters and background of letter boxes. (Default will be yellow background and dark brown letter)
