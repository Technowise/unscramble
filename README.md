# Unscramble Game Overview
This is a game of unscrambling words. The app shows letters of two words jumbled together. Users can tap/click on each of the letters to select, and click on submit after each word is completed. New set of scrambled letters are presented after both the words are solved, or after the timeout. Users can unselect the letter by clicking on the letters in Selected Letters section. All community members are presented with the same set of letters in real-time, and anybody in the subreddit can solve the words. The words are of certain category (for example: Character names of a TV show, Keywords of a programming language etc.)

### How to install and use the app:

1) Moderators of the subreddit can install the app by going to https://developers.reddit.com/apps/unscramble-game
2) After installing the app to your subreddit, go to your subreddit's [three-dot-menu (...)](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/capabilities/menu-actions), and select "Create Unscramble Game post".
3) You will be presented with a form to provide input words, name for what those words represent (for example: Character Names, keywords etc.), and maximum minutes to solve each set of words. For words, provide a comma separated list of words. It would be ideal to provide words without spaces in them. In case the words represent a set of TV character names(like `Eric Cartman`), then it would be ideal to just enter the first part of the name ('Eric') in the list.
4) After you submit the form, your post would be created in the subreddit and game would be open for members to play. If you are on web browser, you will be re-directed to the post as well.
